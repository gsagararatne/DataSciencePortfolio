# DataSciencePortfolio
A collection of selected data science projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting. This also gives me the perfect opportunity to manage this repo via git through git bash.

## Contents
- PythonWebScraping:
  - WebScrapingASong: Web scraped "she's a rebel" by GreenDay by using **BeautifulSoup**. Used a bit of REGEX and `INSPECT ELEMENT` to scrape clean/required lyric.
  - DollarTreeOntarioLocations: Web scraped Dollar Tree locations present in Ontario by using **BeautifulSoup**. Scraped the addresses and geolocations by working with json, regex and `INSPECT ELEMENT`. Plotted the locations of the stores on a map in python.
- BasicCodingProblems:
  - Python:
    - 1_217_ContainsDuplicate.ipynb: first practice python challenge from leetcode. 
- MyFitbitSleepCycle:
  - I bought a Fitbit during my last semester (9th Feb 2021) of university with the intention of tracking and analysing my sleep quality. Extracted my data in json files through an API and analysed my sleeping patterns at different stages of my life (my time from my last semester of uni till I satrted powerlifting post data science bootcamp). Got to do parametric and non parametric tests.

## In Progress
- PythonWebScraping:
  - WebScrapingAnAlbum: Web scraping an album.
  - WebScrapingAnAppReview: Web scraping user reviews off a certain app for future NLP work. Same foundation used for the BrainStation x McDonald's hackathon.
  - WebScrapingTweets: Scraping tweets of BigMouth Season 4 off twitter from users.
- DollarTreeOntarioStoreFinder: Build off of **DollarTreeOntarioLocations** and design a system that will find the closest store to any given location in Ontario.
- BigMouth_S4_NLP: Getting to know the opinions of people on BigMouth's season 4 on Netflix off twitter tweets. Idea popped into my head after talking to my best friends from Bahrain.
